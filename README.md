## How should I use it? (Three options for you to choose from)

### Option A: CLI (Recommended)

The best and most flexible way to use it is to use our CLI in the terminal. You can create and check your solutions using three core commands: `lk`, `lf`, and `lc`.

### Option B: Fork (Supported)

You can also use GitHub's fork feature to create a copy of our project. Then, you can directly use the built-in commands within the project to create and check solutions.

### Option C: Plugin (Supported)

You can also use our `leetcode-practice` plugin available in the plugin marketplace for interactive creation and checking of solutions. (Supported on two popular editors: `WebStorm` and `VS Code`)
